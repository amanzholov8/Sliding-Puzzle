# Sliding-Puzzle
This is 15-puzzle game (where you start with 15 tiles in a 4x4 square, initially in a random permutation, and the goal is to arrange them in the correct order) generalized to grids of arbitrary size

This project is based on http://otfried.org/courses/cs109/project-sliding.html

The cs109.jar file (author: Otfried Cheong) is needed to run this program and it should be moved to the lib folder of Kotlin.

To play this game, use the command line arguments so that you can start the script sliding.kts with arguments for the number of rows and columns (i.e. type in the terminal "kts sliding.kts 3 4"). If the script is called without arguments, then the number of rows and columns is four. 

Use R, L, U, D buttons to control the tiles
